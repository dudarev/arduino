## Setting up hardware

Download arduino from

http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Open project at `DHT-sensor-library/examples/DHTtester/`.

Instructions from there:

Connect pin 2 of the sensor to whatever your DHTPIN is
Connect pin 4 (on the right) of the sensor to GROUND
Connect a 10K resistor from pin 2 (data) to pin 1 (power) of the sensor
